Motus Lux

The Motus Lux is a hardware sequencer designed specifically for use with a modular system. It boosts a Teensy 4.1.
Motus features 8 channels of trigger outputs, 1 clock input, and charges with a normal eurorack socket. The OLED screen provides a user interface that makes for a better user experience, and it also has a push button and encoder for navigation.

Getting Started

To get started with the Motus Lux, you will need to connect it to a modular system. This can be done by plugging it into a normal eurorack socket. You will also need to connect a clock input to the sequencer. Once the hardware is set up, you can begin programming your sequences using the user interface.

Features

The sequencer has several features that make it a valuable addition to any modular system. These include:

8 channels of trigger outputs
1 clock input
OLED screen for user interface
Push button and encoder for navigation

How to Use

To use the Motus Lux, simply plug it into a normal eurorack socket and connect a clock input. You can then program your sequences using the push button and encoder to navigate the user interface.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the sequencer, refer to the documentation or contact the developer for assistance.
